## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps:
- Tik Tok
  video editing tools & sharing fun videos with friends
  
- Spotify
  yearly recap of listening habits & sharing playlists with friends
  
- Instagram
  sharing stories wtih selected friends with close friends list & hiding online status
  
App idea:
A study app that helps users focus by locking users phone for a certain period. However, users can still allow certain apps like Notes or Google to help with studying. It tracks how long you stay focused and gives users daily, weekly, or monthly reports to show users progress.

## Notes

I struggled a bit with navigating the IDE and figuring out where to write the correct code, but I learned a lot through the process.
